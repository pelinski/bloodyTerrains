# blood
3d mesh of the signal coming out of the bloodbathslaughterdiscomachine
programmed on processing to be run in raspberry pi


2d grid with triangles
each vertex is indexed with [x][y]
[x] is the frequency bins (128?)
[y] is the timeline
the vertex/nodes are moved in the [z] direction using the amplitude of the fft
